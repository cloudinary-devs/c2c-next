## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd course-1-media-literacy-for-devs-1
   ```

2. **Navigate to the final directory**
   ```bash
   cd final
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the `final` directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=baseball-cap-store
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER_NAME=baseball-cap-store
   ```

   > **Note**: The upload preset and folder name must be set to `baseball-cap-store` as required by the initialization script.

5. **Initialize Cloudinary assets**

   Upload the logo to your Cloudinary account:
   ```bash
   npm run init
   ```

   This script will:
   - Validate your environment variables
   - Upload the logo from `logo/logo.png` to Cloudinary
   - Set it up as a watermark overlay

## 🌐 Deployment

### Netlify

This project is configured for Netlify deployment with a `netlify.toml` file in the root directory.

1. **Connect your repository** to Netlify
2. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard:
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add all the variables from your `.env.local` file
3. **Deploy**: Netlify will automatically detect the configuration and deploy from the `final` directory

The `netlify.toml` configuration:
- Base directory: `final`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Next.js plugin: Automatically enabled

## 📝 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production with Turbopack
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run init` - Upload logo to Cloudinary (requires `.env.local`)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🔍 Key Files

- `app/page.tsx` - Home page with product listing
- `app/products/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual product detail page
- `components/ProductImage.tsx` - Cloudinary image component with transformations
- `lib/cloudinary.ts` - Cloudinary SDK configuration
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration with file tracing for products.json
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Product pages show server error on Netlify

The `products.json` file is configured to be included in the build via `next.config.ts`. If you still encounter issues:

1. Verify the file path in `next.config.ts` matches your file structure
2. Check that `outputFileTracingIncludes` is correctly configured
3. Ensure the `products` directory is committed to your repository

### Cloudinary images not loading

1. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
2. Check that the upload preset exists in your Cloudinary dashboard
3. Ensure product images are uploaded to the correct folder in Cloudinary
4. Run `npm run init` to upload the logo if it's missing

### Build fails on Netlify

1. Check that all environment variables are set in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify the base directory in `netlify.toml` is correct (`final`)
3. Ensure Node.js version is 20+ in Netlify build settings
